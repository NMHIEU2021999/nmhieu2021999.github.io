Throughout this specification the term GSM refers to GERAN A/Gb mode. AoIP-Selected codec (Target): the codec selected by the target BSS, to be used by the UE/MS in GERAN A/Gb mode after the handover to the BSS using A interface over IP. AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor): a list of codecs for GERAN A/Gb mode derived by the anchor MSC A/3G_MSC-A based on the codecs supported by the MS and the codecs available at the anchor MSC A/3G_MSC-A for A interface over IP, and provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A to MSC-B/3G_MSC-B during Inter-MSC handover/relocation with MAP signalling. Within the list, the codecs are ordered in decreasing order of priority, the first entry in the list being the highest priority codec (preferred codec) and the last entry the lowest priority codec. AoIP-Available Codecs list (MAP): a list of codecs for GERAN A/Gb mode available for the target AoIP interface signalled via MAP. CSG ID list: for a specific PLMN-ID the list of CSG IDs for which the MS has a valid subscription. The CSG ID list for the registered PLMN can be derived from the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS to the anchor MSC. The CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs can be derived from the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR. Iu mode: mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core Network via GERAN or UTRAN and the Iu interface. Throughout this specification the term UMTS refers to UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode. Iur interface: the logical interface between two UTRAN RNSs. Iur-g interface: the logical interface between two BSSs or a BSC and an RNC and it is only considered in Iu mode. Iu Currently used codec: the codec used by the UE/MS in UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode before a handover or SRNS relocation. Iu Selected codec: the codec to be used by the UE/MS in UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode after the handover or SRNS relocation. Iu Supported Codecs List: a list of codecs supported by the MS and by the core network, provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A to 3G_MSC-B during Inter-MSC handover/relocation. The Iu Supported Codecs List may contain separate list of codecs for UTRAN Iu mode and GERAN Iu mode. Within each list, the codecs are ordered in decreasing order of priority, the first entry in the list being the highest priority codec (preferred codec) and the last entry the lowest priority codec. Default speech codec: In UTRAN Iu mode the default speech codec is the UMTS AMR or UMTS AMR2 codec, dependent on the capabilities of the UE/MS. For a description of how the network determines the default UMTS speech codec, see 3GPP TS 24.008 [10], subclause 5.2.1.11. If necessary, 3G_MSC-B shall use the Radio Resource Information instead of the GSM Bearer Capability, since the GSM Bearer Capability is not available in MSC-B. In GERAN Iu mode the default speech codec is the AMR FR codec. SRVCC MSC: MSC server enhanced for SRVCC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] subclause 5.3.2. vSRVCC MSC: MSC server enhanced for vSRVCC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] subclause 5.3.2a. UE Specific Behaviour Information - Iu (UESBI-Iu): information that is sent from the MSC to the RAN and that can be used to derive specific information about the UE's capabilities. For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] apply: SRVCC vSRVCC For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in 3GPP TS 23.237 [31] apply: SCC AS For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] apply: CSG cell 4 Role, functional composition of MSCs and interfaces for handover 4.1 MSC-A 4.1.1 Role of MSC-A In the Intra-MSC handover case (including \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" with AoIP), the MSC A (simply termed MSC) controls the call, the mobility management and the radio resources before, during and after an Intra-MSC handover. When BSSAP procedures have to be performed, they are initiated and driven by MSC A. If AoIP is supported by MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the MSC-A may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in subclause 6.3. In the Inter-MSC handover case, MSC A is the MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the MS, they are initiated and driven by MSC A. The MSC A - MSC B interface works as a MSC - BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures, described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are only those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by MSC B between MSC A and the MS. During a basic handover, MSC A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from MSC B on E-interface). For handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-A can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18]. During a subsequent handover back to MSC A, MSC A acts as a BSS towards MSC B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to MSC B from MSC A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at MSC A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Handover Failure from BSS-A). During a subsequent handover to a third MSC, MSC A works towards MSC B' as described above in the basic handover paragraph and towards MSC B as described above in subsequent handover paragraph. In the Inter-System, inter-MSC handover case, MSC A is the MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the MS, they are initiated and driven by MSC A. The MSC A - 3G_MSC B interface works as a MSC - BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures, described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are only those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by 3G_MSC B between MSC A and the MS. During a basic inter-system handover, MSC A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from 3G_MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent inter-system handover back to MSC A, MSC A acts as a BSS towards 3G_MSC B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC B from MSC A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at MSC A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Handover Failure from BSS-A). During a subsequent inter-system handover to a third MSC, MSC A works towards 3G_MSC B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards 3G_MSC B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph. If MSC-A supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), it shall send UESBI-Iu to the target MSC during basic and subsequent handover, and basic and subsequent inter-system handover. MSC-A may support inter-MSC inter-system handover to a CSG cell. If MSC-A supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-A and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-A checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS before proceeding with the handover procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, the MSC-A considers the membership check as failed. If for a specific PLMN-ID an entry with the same CSG ID exists in both CSS subscription data and HLR subscription data, the CSG subscription data from the HLR shall take precedence over the data from CSS. NOTE 1: If MSC-A does not support CSG membership checking, and a CSG cell is configured as possible handover target, MSC-A will proceed with the handover to the CSG cell. If the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, MSC-A will not proceed with the handover. For handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, MSC-A shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover procedure. For inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the HLR or the CSS provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN, MSC-A shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN. NOTE 2: Due to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN. If the HLR did not provide any CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, then based on operator's configuration the MSC-A may allow the handover by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID. Otherwise, MSC-A shall reject the handover due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available. NOTE 3: If MSC-A uses the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN used by MSC-A and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN used by the UE. If the HLR provided CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, this restriction does not apply. For subsequent inter-MSC handover to a third 3G_MSC-B', if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B belongs to a different PLMN than MSC-A, then as an operator option MSC-A may perform an additional CSG membership check for the target cell. 4.1.2 Functional composition of MSC A and its interfaces for handover In order to simplify the description of the handover procedures the controlling MSC (MSC A) can be considered to be composed of five functional units, as shown in figure 1. Signalling functions: 1) BSC/MSC (MS/BSC) Procedures MSC A. This unit is used to control the signalling between the MSC, BSC and MS. Interface A' is the connection to the old BSC and interface A'' is the connection to the new BSC, when an Intra-MSC handover takes place. Interface x represents the interworking connection to the Handover Control Procedures MSC A. 2) Call Control Procedures MSC A. This unit is used to control the call. Interface B' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic handover from MSC A to MSC B is to be performed then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to MSC B. If a Subsequent handover to MSC B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from MSC A to 3G_MSC B is to be performed, then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC B. If a subsequent inter-system handover to 3G_MSC B' is to be performed, then interface B''' is used. 3) Handover Control Procedures MSC A. This unit provides both the overall control of the handover procedure and interworking between the internal interfaces (x, y and z). 4) MAP Procedures MSC A. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange of MAP messages between MSCs during an Inter-MSC handover, or between MSC A and 3G_MSC B during an Inter-system Inter-MSC handover. This unit communicates with the Handover Control Procedures MSC A via interface z. Switching functions: 5) Switch and Handover Device MSC A. For all calls, except for ongoing voice group calls (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [3] for a definition) this unit is responsible for connecting the new path into the network via interface B'. In the case of ongoing voice group calls this unit is responsible for maintaining the connection between the down link group call channels and the active uplink. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the MSC concerning the handover device. The handover device interconnections are illustrated in figure 2. For MS to MS calls in the same MSC the configuration in figure 2b applies. In this case interface B'' is internal to MSC A and does not connect to another MSC. The handover device can either be a three-party bridge or a switching facility without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-party bridge configuration the states of the handover device are as shown in table 1. The three party configuration exists in the intermediate state. This type of handover device may reduce the interruption time. However, this may require noise reduction if one of the radio channels is unterminated at some time in the intermediate state. For a handover device consisting of a simple switch there will be no intermediate state. 4.2 MSC-B 4.2.1 Role of MSC-B In the Intra-MSC-B handover cases (including \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" with AoIP), the MSC B keeps the control of the whole Intra-MSC-B handover procedure. MSC-B notifies MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A of a successful Intra-MSC-B handover completion by using the A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message. If AoIP is supported by MSC-B and BSS, then the BSS or the MSC-B may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in subclause 6.3. The role of MSC B is also to provide transcoder resources, if AoIP is supported and no transcoder is inserted in the BSS. In the Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSC B (MSC B') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that MSC B keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSC B will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between A interface and E-interface. MSC A initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSC B, while MSC B controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSC B is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSC B and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSC B and BSS B, and is not directly controlled by MSC A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSC B shall transfer this clearing indication to MSC A, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with MSC A through the E interface, and to release its circuit connection with MSC A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSC B, when the dialogue with MSC A ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSC A, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSC A ends abnormally. When a release is received by MSC B for the circuit connection with MSC A then MSC B shall release the circuit connection. In the Inter-system Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSC B (MSC B') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that MSC B keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSC B will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between A interface and E-interface. 3G_MSC A initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSC B, while MSC B controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSC B is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSC B and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSC B and BSS B, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSC A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSC B shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSC A, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSC A through the E interface, and to release its circuit connection with 3G_MSC A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSC B, when the dialogue with 3G_MSC A ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSC A, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSC A ends abnormally. When a release is received by MSC B for the circuit connection with 3G_MSC A then MSC B shall release the circuit connection. For subsequent inter-MSC handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-B can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18]. MSC-B may support subsequent inter-MSC inter-system handover to a CSG cell. If MSC-B supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover before proceeding with the subsequent handover procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, MSC-B considers the membership check as failed. NOTE 1: If MSC-B does not support CSG membership checking, and a CSG cell is configured as possible handover target, MSC-B will proceed with the subsequent handover to the CSG cell. If the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, MSC-B will not proceed with the handover. For subsequent handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover procedure. For subsequent inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover, MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN. NOTE 2: Due to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN. If the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of MSC-B, then based on operator's configuration the MSC-B may allow the handover by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, MSC-B shall reject the handover due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available. NOTE 3: If MSC-B uses the CSG ID list of the PLMN of MSC-B for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the PLMN of MSC-B which is used by MSC-B and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN which is used by the UE. If MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN of the subsequent inter-MSC handover, this restriction does not apply. 4.2.2 Functional composition of MSC B and its interfaces for handover The functional composition of an MSC acting as MSC B is essentially the same as that of MSC A. However, there are some differences. The functional units are as follows (see figure 3). Signalling functions: 1) BSC/MSC (MS/BSC) Procedures MSC B. This unit is used to control the signalling between the MSC, BSC and MS. Interface A'' is the connection to the new BSC, when an Intra-MSC handover takes place. Interface x represents the interworking connection to the Handover Control Procedures MSC B. 2) Call Control Procedures MSC B. This unit is used for normal call control and signalling to MSC A, or 3G_MSC A in the case of inter-system inter-MSC handover. 3) Handover Control Procedures MSC B. This unit provides both the overall control of the handover procedure and interworking between the internal interfaces (x, y and z) in MSC B. 4) MAP Procedures MSC B. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange of MAP messages between MSC A, or 3G_MSC A, and MSC B and for signalling to the VLR in MSC B. Switching functions: 5) Switch MSC B. For all calls, except ongoing voice group calls (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [3] for a definition) this unit is responsible, with BSS-B, for connecting the circuit from MSC A, or 3G_MSC A, to BSS-B. This unit may also need to act as a handover device for Intra-MSC handovers controlled by MSC B. In the case of ongoing voice group calls this unit is responsible for maintaining the connection between the group member currently assigned the uplink and the distribution device. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the MSC concerning the handover device. 4.3 3G_MSC-A 4.3.1 Role of 3G_MSC A In the Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation case, 3G_MSC A controls the call, the mobility management and the radio resources before, during and after an Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation. When RANAP or BSSMAP procedures have to be performed, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC A. In a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" option, 3G_MSC-A may optionally use a global title based on the Global RNC-Id for the addressing of the Iu interface messages towards the target RNC. For handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-A can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover/relocation target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18]. In the case of intra-3G_MSC-A handover of a speech call, 3G_MSC A controls the transcoder in the core network. The 3G_MSC A determines, if a transcoder is required to be inserted or released in the CN. If AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-A may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in subclause 6.3. In the case of Inter-3G_MSC relocation, 3G_MSC-A links out the transcoder. In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC A is the 3G_MSC that controls the call and the mobility management of the UE during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent relocation. When RANAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC A. The 3G_MSC A - 3G_MSC B interface works as a 3G_MSC - RNS interface for the RANAP procedures. The Direct Transfer signalling is relayed transparently by 3G_MSC B between 3G_MSC A and the UE. During a successful relocation the order to perform location reporting at change of Service Area is not transferred to the target RNS. In the Intra-3G_MSC-A relocation case, the 3G_MSC-A re-issues the Location Reporting Control towards the target RNS. In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC-A keeps the control of the Location Report Control procedure. However, re-issuing the Iu-LOCATION-REPORTING-CONTROL messages due to subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B relocations is the responsibility of 3G_MSC-B. During a basic relocation, 3G_MSC A initiates and controls all the relocation procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Relocation Complete from 3G_MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent relocation back to 3G_MSC A, 3G_MSC A acts as an RNS towards 3G_MSC B, which controls the relocation procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Relocation Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC B from 3G_MSC A). Then all relocation related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC A (e.g. Relocation Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A). During a subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B', 3G_MSC A works towards 3G_MSC B' as described above in the basic relocation paragraph and towards 3G_MSC B as described above in subsequent relocation paragraph. In the Inter-System, inter-3G_MSC handover case, 3G_MSC A is the 3G_MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the UE/MS during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent inter-system handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE/MS, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC A. The 3G_MSC A \u2013 MSC B interface works as a 3G_MSC \u2013 BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by MSC B between 3G_MSC A and the UE/MS. During a basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover, 3G_MSC A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover back to 3G_MSC A, 3G_MSC A acts as a BSS towards 3G_MSC B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC B from 3G_MSC A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A). During a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover to a third 3G_MSC, 3G_MSC A works towards MSC B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards 3G_MSC B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph. During a basic inter-system GSM to UMTS handover, 3G_MSC A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from 3G_MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover back to 3G_MSC A, 3G_MSC A acts as an RNS towards MSC B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to MSC B from 3G_MSC A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC A (e.g. Relocation Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Handover Failure from BSS A). During a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover to a third 3G_MSC, 3G_MSC A works towards 3G_MSC B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards MSC B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph. 3G_MSC-A may assign a priority level defined as RAB parameter in 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] for each bearer. In case of relocation of a multicall configuration the 3G_MSC-B or the target RNC shall select the bearers to be handed over according to the priority level, if the target cell is not able to accommodate all bearers. If a selection has to be made between bearers of the same priority level, then the selection criteria are implementation dependent. For network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401 [20], subclause 7.2.3) 3G MSC-A shall send the SNA information to 3G_MSC-B except for emergency calls. If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description applies: In the Intra-3G_MSC relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to a new RNS. In the basic relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the selected bearer. In the subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B' case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B'. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B' does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the selected bearer. In the Intra-3G_MSC inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case and the basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case, the 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries to handover the selected bearer. In all cases described above, 3G_MSC-A shall release some calls which has been carried by the bearers failed to set up in new RNS or the bearers not to be handed over. If 3G_MSC-A supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), it shall send UESBI-Iu to the RNS-B during intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and during subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A. Furthermore, 3G_MSC-A shall send UESBI-Iu to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-MSC handover, and basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation. For a SCUDIF call (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [22]) 3G_MSC-A may send information of the alternative radio access bearer to the target RNS during the intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation or assignment. 3G_MSC-A may support inter-system handover or SRNS relocation to a CSG cell. If 3G_MSC-A supports handover/relocation to a CSG cell, the serving BSS or RNS is served by 3G_MSC-A and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then 3G_MSC-A checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS before proceeding with the handover/relocation procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, the 3G_MSC-A considers the membership check as failed. If for a specific PLMN-ID the same CSG ID exists in both CSS subscription data and HLR subscription data, the CSG subscription data from the HLR shall take precedence over the data from CSS. NOTE 1: If 3G_MSC-A does not support CSG membership checking, and a CSG cell is configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-A will proceed with the handover/relocation to the CSG cell; if the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-A will not proceed with the handover/relocation. For handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover/relocation procedure. For inter-PLMN handover/relocation to a CSG cell, if the HLR or the CSS provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN, 3G_MSC-A shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN. NOTE 2: Due to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN. If the HLR did not provide any CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, then based on operator's configuration the 3G_MSC-A may allow the handover/relocation by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID. Otherwise, 3G_MSC-A shall reject the handover/relocation due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available. NOTE 3: If 3G_MSC-A uses the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN used by 3G_MSC-A and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN used by the UE. If the HLR provided CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, this restriction does not apply. For subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B', if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B belongs to a different PLMN than 3G_MSC-A, then as an operator option MSC-A may perform an additional CSG membership check for the target cell. 4.3.2 Functional composition of 3G_MSC A and its interfaces for handover/relocation In order to simplify the description of the handover/relocation procedures the controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC A) can be considered to be composed of five functional units, as shown in figure 4. Signalling functions: 1) RNC/BSC/3G_MSC (UE/MS/RNC/BSC) Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit is used to control the signalling between the 3G_MSC, RNC or BSC and UE/MS. Interface Iu' is the connection to the old RNC and interface Iu'' is the connection to the new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC relocation takes place. Interface Iu' is the connection to the old RNC and interface A'' is the connection to the new BSC, when an Intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover takes place. Interface A' is the connection to the old BSC and interface Iu'' is the connection to the new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover takes place. Interface x represents the interworking connection to the Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC A. 2) Call Control Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit is used to control the call. Interface B' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic relocation from 3G_MSC A to 3G_MSC B is to be performed then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC B. If a Subsequent handover/relocation to 3G_MSC B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from 3G_MSC A to 3G_MSC B is to be performed, then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC B. If a Subsequent inter-system handover to 3G_MSC B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. 3) Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit provides both the overall control of the handover/relocation procedure and interworking between the internal interfaces (x, y and z). 4) MAP Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange of MAP messages between 3G_MSCs during an Inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation, or between 3G_MSC A and MSC B during an Inter-system Inter-3G_MSC handover. This unit communicates with the Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC A via interface z. Switching functions: 5) Switch and Handover/Relocation Device 3G_MSC A. For all calls this unit is responsible for connecting the new path into the network via interface B'. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the 3G_MSC concerning the handover/relocation device. The handover/relocation device interconnections are illustrated in figure 5. For UE/MS to UE/MS calls in the same 3G_MSC the configuration in figure 5b applies. In this case interface B'' is internal to 3G_MSC A and does not connect to another 3G_MSC. The handover/relocation device can be either a three-party bridge or a switching facility without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-party bridge configuration the states of the handover/relocation device are as shown in table 2. The three-party configuration exists in the intermediate state. This type of handover/relocation device may reduce the interruption time. However, this may require noise reduction if one of the radio channels is unterminated at some time in the intermediate state. For a handover/relocation device consisting of a simple switch there will be no intermediate state.","title":"3GPP TS 23.009 V16.0.0 (2020-07)"},{"location":"23009-g00/#3gpp-ts-23009-v1600-2020-07","text":"Technical Specification","title":"3GPP TS 23.009 V16.0.0 (2020-07)"},{"location":"23009-g00/#3-abbreviations-and-definitions","text":"","title":"3    Abbreviations and definitions"},{"location":"23009-g00/#31-abbreviations","text":"For the purpose of the present document, the following abbreviations apply: | | | |--|--| |3G_MSC-A| third generation MSC that supports the Iu interface and optionally the A interface | |3G_MSC-A| The controlling 3G_MSC on which the call was originally established| |3G_MSC-B| The 3G_MSC to which the UE is handed over in a Basic Handover| |3G_MSC B'| The 3G_MSC to which the UE is handed over in a Subsequent Handover| |BSC| Base Station Controller| |BSS| Base Station System| |BSS-A| The BSS from which the MS is being handed over |BSS-B| The BSS to which the MS is being handed over |BTS| Base Transceiver Station |CSG| Closed Subscriber Group |CSS| CSG Subscriber Server |E-UTRAN| Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network |GERAN| GSM EDGE Radio Access Network |ISC| International Switching Centre |LCLS| Local Call Local Switch |MS| Mobile Station |MSC| A second generation Mobile Services Switching Centre that only supports the A interface |MSC-A| The controlling MSC on which the call was originally established |MSC-B| The MSC to which the MS is handed over in a Basic Handover |MSC-B'| The MSC to which the MS is handed over in a Subsequent Handover |MME| Mobility Management Entity |RNC| Radio Network Controller |RNS| Radio Network Subsystem |SBSS| Serving BSS |SNA| Shared Network Area |SRNS| Serving RNS |STN-SR| Session Transfer Number for SR-VCC |UE|A User Equipment is a terminal that supports USIM and the UMTS Uu interface |UE/MS| A terminal that supports USIM, SIM, the Uu interface and the Um interface |UESBI| UE Specific Behaviour Information |USIM| UMTS Subscriber Identity Module Other abbreviations used in the GSM specifications are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905 [2a].","title":"3.1 Abbreviations"},{"location":"23009-g00/#32-definitions","text":"The following terms are used in this Technical Specification: A/Gb mode: mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core Network via GERAN and the A and/or Gb interfaces.

If AoIP is supported by MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the MSC-A may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in subclause 6.3. In the Inter-MSC handover case, MSC A is the MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent handover.

During a subsequent handover to a third MSC, MSC A works towards MSC B' as described above in the basic handover paragraph and towards MSC B as described above in subsequent handover paragraph. In the Inter-System, inter-MSC handover case, MSC A is the MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent handover.

In the case of ongoing voice group calls this unit is responsible for maintaining the connection between the group member currently assigned the uplink and the distribution device. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the MSC concerning the handover device.","title":"4.2.2  Functional composition of MSC B and its interfaces for handover"},{"location":"23009-g00/#43-3g_msc-a","text":"","title":"4.3 3G_MSC-A"},{"location":"23009-g00/#431-role-of-3g_msc-a","text":"In the Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation case, 3G_MSC A controls the call, the mobility management and the radio resources before, during and after an Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation. When RANAP or BSSMAP procedures have to be performed, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC A. In a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" option, 3G_MSC-A may optionally use a global title based on the Global RNC-Id for the addressing of the Iu interface messages towards the target RNC. For handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-A can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover/relocation target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18]. In the case of intra-3G_MSC-A handover of a speech call, 3G_MSC A controls the transcoder in the core network. The 3G_MSC A determines, if a transcoder is required to be inserted or released in the CN. If AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-A may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in subclause 6.3. In the case of Inter-3G_MSC relocation, 3G_MSC-A links out the transcoder. In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC A is the 3G_MSC that controls the call and the mobility management of the UE during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent relocation. When RANAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC A. The 3G_MSC A - 3G_MSC B interface works as a 3G_MSC - RNS interface for the RANAP procedures. The Direct Transfer signalling is relayed transparently by 3G_MSC B between 3G_MSC A and the UE. During a successful relocation the order to perform location reporting at change of Service Area is not transferred to the target RNS. In the Intra-3G_MSC-A relocation case, the 3G_MSC-A re-issues the Location Reporting Control towards the target RNS. In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC-A keeps the control of the Location Report Control procedure. However, re-issuing the Iu-LOCATION-REPORTING-CONTROL messages due to subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B relocations is the responsibility of 3G_MSC-B. During a basic relocation, 3G_MSC A initiates and controls all the relocation procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Relocation Complete from 3G_MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent relocation back to 3G_MSC A, 3G_MSC A acts as an RNS towards 3G_MSC B, which controls the relocation procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Relocation Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC B from 3G_MSC A). Then all relocation related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC A (e.g. Relocation Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A). During a subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B', 3G_MSC A works towards 3G_MSC B' as described above in the basic relocation paragraph and towards 3G_MSC B as described above in subsequent relocation paragraph. In the Inter-System, inter-3G_MSC handover case, 3G_MSC A is the 3G_MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the UE/MS during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent inter-system handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE/MS, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC A. The 3G_MSC A \u2013 MSC B interface works as a 3G_MSC \u2013 BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by MSC B between 3G_MSC A and the UE/MS. During a basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover, 3G_MSC A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover back to 3G_MSC A, 3G_MSC A acts as a BSS towards 3G_MSC B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC B from 3G_MSC A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A). During a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover to a third 3G_MSC, 3G_MSC A works towards MSC B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards 3G_MSC B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph. During a basic inter-system GSM to UMTS handover, 3G_MSC A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from 3G_MSC B on E-interface). During a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover back to 3G_MSC A, 3G_MSC A acts as an RNS towards MSC B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to MSC B from 3G_MSC A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC A (e.g. Relocation Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Handover Failure from BSS A). During a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover to a third 3G_MSC, 3G_MSC A works towards 3G_MSC B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards MSC B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph. 3G_MSC-A may assign a priority level defined as RAB parameter in 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] for each bearer. In case of relocation of a multicall configuration the 3G_MSC-B or the target RNC shall select the bearers to be handed over according to the priority level, if the target cell is not able to accommodate all bearers. If a selection has to be made between bearers of the same priority level, then the selection criteria are implementation dependent. For network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401 [20], subclause 7.2.3) 3G MSC-A shall send the SNA information to 3G_MSC-B except for emergency calls. If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description applies: In the Intra-3G_MSC relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to a new RNS. In the basic relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the selected bearer. In the subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B' case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B'. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B' does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the selected bearer. In the Intra-3G_MSC inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case and the basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case, the 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries to handover the selected bearer. In all cases described above, 3G_MSC-A shall release some calls which has been carried by the bearers failed to set up in new RNS or the bearers not to be handed over. If 3G_MSC-A supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), it shall send UESBI-Iu to the RNS-B during intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and during subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A. Furthermore, 3G_MSC-A shall send UESBI-Iu to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-MSC handover, and basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation. For a SCUDIF call (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [22]) 3G_MSC-A may send information of the alternative radio access bearer to the target RNS during the intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation or assignment. 3G_MSC-A may support inter-system handover or SRNS relocation to a CSG cell. If 3G_MSC-A supports handover/relocation to a CSG cell, the serving BSS or RNS is served by 3G_MSC-A and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then 3G_MSC-A checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS before proceeding with the handover/relocation procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, the 3G_MSC-A considers the membership check as failed. If for a specific PLMN-ID the same CSG ID exists in both CSS subscription data and HLR subscription data, the CSG subscription data from the HLR shall take precedence over the data from CSS. NOTE 1: If 3G_MSC-A does not support CSG membership checking, and a CSG cell is configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-A will proceed with the handover/relocation to the CSG cell; if the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-A will not proceed with the handover/relocation. For handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover/relocation procedure. For inter-PLMN handover/relocation to a CSG cell, if the HLR or the CSS provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN, 3G_MSC-A shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN. NOTE 2: Due to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN. If the HLR did not provide any CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, then based on operator's configuration the 3G_MSC-A may allow the handover/relocation by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID. Otherwise, 3G_MSC-A shall reject the handover/relocation due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available. NOTE 3: If 3G_MSC-A uses the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN used by 3G_MSC-A and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN used by the UE. If the HLR provided CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, this restriction does not apply. For subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B', if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B belongs to a different PLMN than 3G_MSC-A, then as an operator option MSC-A may perform an additional CSG membership check for the target cell.","title":"4.3.1  Role of 3G_MSC A"},{"location":"23009-g00/#432-functional-composition-of-3g_msc-a-and-its-interfaces-for-handoverrelocation","text":"In order to simplify the description of the handover/relocation procedures the controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC A) can be considered to be composed of five functional units, as shown in figure 4. Signalling functions: 1) RNC/BSC/3G_MSC (UE/MS/RNC/BSC) Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit is used to control the signalling between the 3G_MSC, RNC or BSC and UE/MS. Interface Iu' is the connection to the old RNC and interface Iu'' is the connection to the new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC relocation takes place. Interface Iu' is the connection to the old RNC and interface A'' is the connection to the new BSC, when an Intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover takes place. Interface A' is the connection to the old BSC and interface Iu'' is the connection to the new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover takes place. Interface x represents the interworking connection to the Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC A. 2) Call Control Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit is used to control the call. Interface B' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic relocation from 3G_MSC A to 3G_MSC B is to be performed then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC B. If a Subsequent handover/relocation to 3G_MSC B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from 3G_MSC A to 3G_MSC B is to be performed, then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC B. If a Subsequent inter-system handover to 3G_MSC B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. 3) Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit provides both the overall control of the handover/relocation procedure and interworking between the internal interfaces (x, y and z). 4) MAP Procedures 3G_MSC A. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange of MAP messages between 3G_MSCs during an Inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation, or between 3G_MSC A and MSC B during an Inter-system Inter-3G_MSC handover. This unit communicates with the Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC A via interface z. Switching functions: 5) Switch and Handover/Relocation Device 3G_MSC A. For all calls this unit is responsible for connecting the new path into the network via interface B'. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the 3G_MSC concerning the handover/relocation device. The handover/relocation device interconnections are illustrated in figure 5. For UE/MS to UE/MS calls in the same 3G_MSC the configuration in figure 5b applies. In this case interface B'' is internal to 3G_MSC A and does not connect to another 3G_MSC. The handover/relocation device can be either a three-party bridge or a switching facility without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-party bridge configuration the states of the handover/relocation device are as shown in table 2. The three-party configuration exists in the intermediate state. This type of handover/relocation device may reduce the interruption time. However, this may require noise reduction if one of the radio channels is unterminated at some time in the intermediate state. For a handover/relocation device consisting of a simple switch there will be no intermediate state.","title":"4.3.2  Functional composition of 3G_MSC A and its interfaces for handover/relocation"},{"location":"hello/","text":"Hello Again This is regular text generated from regular Markdown.
